Presented in the form of a dining table setting, ‘Shared Plates’ showcases notions of food in relation to identity, nostalgia, the “everyday”, and cross-cultural exchange. Originating from different backgrounds, the exhibiting artists have, thus far, developed ongoing conversations between themselves around their individual experiences and viewpoints of growing up in different cultures. 

I exhibited a piece from my honours project, IMPORT/EXPORT zine, and designed the branding and identity for the exhibition.
