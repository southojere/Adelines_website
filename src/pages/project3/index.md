This project demonstrates the friendship shared between two people despite in cities on opposite ends of the planet. 

Jason and I first met when he came to New Zealand for a student exchange at my university. Long story short, we became very close friends during his 5 months here. After he returned back home to America, our main way of communicating was online. But we felt that the conversations we have not only between us, but also with others, sometimes felt forced. Nothing felt genuine anymore and we were just talking for the sake of being in touch. 

And so this is where the 10 Letters Project comes in! Me and Jason decided that we would only communicate through physical mail for a certain amount of time and drafted 10 rules that we must follow during the project. 

The first letter was sent on November 14, 2016. The last letter was received on May 3rd, 2017. The project lasted a total of 171 days.
