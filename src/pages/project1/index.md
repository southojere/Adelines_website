Ro grew up in Singapore where Asian snacks could be found at every corner of the block. Adeline grew up in New Zealand where Asian snacks were quite limited, so she only ate them every now and then. When Ro and Adeline met, Asian snacks were one of the things that helped them connect to one another. 

Food is important to many of us as it is a way to stay connected to our cultural roots. IMPORT/EXPORT focuses on sharing our culture through stories of Asian snacks from not only Asians but also other ethnicitiesâ€” creating a conversation and an exchange of cultures and perspectives. Throughout this project, we have explored the aesthetics of the vernacular which can be seen often in Asian food packagings and supermarkets. We have collected and compiled a range of personal stories into a package; this can be essentially seen as a gift of our culture to you!
